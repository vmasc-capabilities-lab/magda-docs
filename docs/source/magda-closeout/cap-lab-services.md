# Capabilites Lab Services

While developing within Magda, the Capabilites Lab came across challenges that required us to build our own solutions to solve. 

We created two services that have different use cases.


## Magda-API
First we have 'Magda-API' which is a NodeJS solution that contains Magda API helper functions that preform certain tasks such as creating an apsect, fetching data, and identifying format. 

We created and utilized these API helper functions due to format inconsistencies when connecting to Norfolk and Virginia datasets.

You can find the [Magda-API hosted on our Azure DevOps Repository](https://dev.azure.com/CapabilitiesLab/_git/Magda?path=/CapabilitiesLab/Services/Magda-API).

## Flask-API
