## Magda

The current version of magda is based off of the [magda](https://github.com/magda-io/magda) repository. Magda was created by CSIRO's [Data61](https://data61.csiro.au/) and Australia's [Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet](https://www.pmc.gov.au/).

You can access the Capabilities Lab Magda Website:  [http://dn.datacube.online](http://dn.datacube.online)

## Version Control, Project Repository Structure, & Branch Methodology

* Recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Branching Methodology: [Git Flow Model](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
  * Automated Kanban boards are being utilized through a shared repository model
    * How we utilize this and going forward: Pull Requests help start a code review process to other team member(s) who can then double check on the issue/work before bringing it back into the main branch
  * Main Branch is always deployable and we won't be pushing back to main until we have gone through a PR request as mentioned above
  * The [PR requests should always be linked with issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)


## Project Board(s) and Work Breakdowns

* VCL-Magda planning and roadmaping are still actively being decided but will be represented by [Azure Epics](https://dev.azure.com/CapabilitiesLab/Magda/_boards/board/t/Magda%20Team/Epics/) as we work.
